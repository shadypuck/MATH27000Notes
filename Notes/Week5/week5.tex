    \begin{equation*}
        \int_\gamma f\dd{z} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    \item Proposition: If $f:U\to\C$ is continuous and $\int_\gamma f\dd{z}=0$ for every closed loop in $U$, then $f$ has a primitive on $U$.
    \begin{proof}
        Step 1: Choose the integral along arbitrary $\gamma$.\par
        Step 2: Choice of $\gamma$ doesn't matter (closed loop condition).\par

    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{n\to\infty}\left| a_n \right|^{1/n}
    \end{equation*}
    \item \textbf{Majorant test}: If $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k$ is a convergent series with positive terms and if for almost all $k$ and all $z\in M$ we have $|f_k(z)|\leq a_k$, then $\sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k$ is absolutely uniformly convergent on $M$.

    \item Claim/TPS: This argument shows that if $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ are homotopic in $U$ and $f\in\mO(U)$, then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_\gamma f\dd{z} = \int_{\tilde{\gamma}}f\dd{z}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Each bump is a closed loop for the CIT.
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary: Let $U$ be any domain, $D$ be a disk in $U$, and $z\in\mathring{D}$. Suppose $f\in\mO(U\setminus\{z\})$ and is bounded near $z$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_{\partial D}f\dd{z} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Homotopy and $\gamma_\varepsilon$.
    \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Cauchy Integral Formula}: Suppose $U$ is any domain, $D\subset U$ is a disk (i.e., $D\subset\subset U$ or $\overline{D}\subset U$), $f\in\mO(U)$, and $z\in D$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\dd\zeta
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Define the helper function
        \begin{equation*}
            g(\zeta) =
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{f(\zeta)-f(z)}{\zeta-z} & \zeta\neq z\\
                f'(z) & \zeta=z
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        It integrates to zero on $\partial D$ and then splits into the two sides of the CIF.
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary: Holomorphic functions are $C^\infty$.
    \item Corollary: In general,
    \begin{equation*}
        f^{(n)}(z) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}\dd\zeta
    \end{equation*}
    \item \textbf{Cauchy's inequalities}:
    \begin{equation*}
        |f^{(n)}(z)| \leq \frac{n!}{R^n}\max_{\partial D}|f(\zeta)|
    \end{equation*}
    \item Liouville's Theorem: Suppose $f\in\mO(\C)$ (i.e., $f$ is \textbf{entire}) and $f$ is bounded. Then it's constant.
    \begin{proof}
        Cauchy's inequalities on a really big disk to limit $|f'|$.
    \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Entire} (function): A complex-valued function that is holomorphic on the whole complex plane.
    \item The Identity Theorem: If two holomorphic functions $f,g\in\mO(U)$ agree on an open set in $U$, then $f=g$.
    \begin{proof}
        True for power series.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In fact, more is true: If $z_n\to z_0$ where each $z_n$ is distinct and $f(z_n)=g(z_n)$ for all $n$, then $f=g$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Analytic continuation} (of $f$): The function $g\in\mO(V)$ where $f\in\mO(U)$, $V\supset U$, and $f=g$ on $U$.
    \item Morera's Theorem: If $U$ is any domain, $f:U\to\C$ is continuous, and $\int_\triangle f\dd{z}=0$ for all triangles, then $f$ is holomorphic.
    \begin{proof}
        The primitive exists. The primitive is holomorphic. Therefore, $F'=f$ is holomorphic.
    \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Riemann's removable singularity theorem}: Suppose $U$ is a domain, $z\in U$, $f\in\mO(U\setminus\{z\})$, and $f$ is bounded near $z$. Then there exists a unique analytic continuation $\hat{f}\in\mO(U)$. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{Riemann extension theorem}.
    \begin{proof}
        Define a helper function
        \begin{equation*}
            F(\zeta) =
            \begin{cases}
                f(\zeta)(\zeta-z) & \zeta\neq z\\
                0 & \zeta=z
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        Use Morera's theorem: $F$ is continuous, triangles in two cases (CIT and $\gamma_\varepsilon$), and $F'=f$ via the limit definition.
    \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Singularity} (of $f$): A point $z_0$ such that $f\in\mO(U\setminus\{z_0\})$.
    \item \textbf{Removable} (singularity): A singularity of a function that that satisfies the hypotheses of Riemann's removable singularity theorem.
    \item If a singularity is not removable, then $f$ is not bounded near $z_0$. This leads to additional definitions.
    \item \textbf{Pole}: A non-removable singularity $z_0$ of a function $f$ for which $|f(z)|\to\infty$ as $z\to z_0$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item So-named because of real analysis where a pole is an asymptote, and asymptotes kind of look like poles!
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Essential} (singularity): A non-removable singularity that is not a pole; equivalently, a singularity $z_0$ for which there exist sequences $z_n\to z_0$ and $w_n\to z_0$ such that $|f(z_n)|\to\infty$ and $|f(w_n)|$ stays bounded.
    \item \textbf{Meromorphic} (function): A function $f:U\to\C$ such that $f\in\mO(U\setminus P)$ and each $p\in P$ is a pole, where $P\subset U$ is a finite set of points.
    \item Orders of zeros and poles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Invert the function, find a power series, divide $(z-p)^L$ out, find the power series of $h$, invert, find the principal part of the \textbf{Laurent series}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Theorem (maximum modulus principle): Let $f\in\mO(U)$. If $|f(z)|$ has a local maximum on $U$, then $f$ is constant.
    \begin{proof}
        Step 1: Long inequality through the CIF that becomes equality.\par
        Step 2: Subtract and get integrand equal to zero; $|f|$ is constant on $\partial D$.\par
        Step 3: $|f|^2$ is constant on $\partial D$, differentiate, casework to $f$ is constant or zero.
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary (minimum modulus principle): If $f\in\mO(U)$, $f\neq 0$ on $U$ (hence $1/f\in\mO(U)$), and $|f(z)|$ takes a minimum in $U$, then $f$ is constant.
\end{itemize}

    then there is a sequence of points $z_n\in\C$ such that $|f(z_n)-g(z_n)|\to\infty$.
    \item For any sequence of positive real numbers $\{a_k\}$ and any point $z\in\C$, there is a function $f$, holomorphic in a neighborhood of $z$, such that $|f^{(k)}(z)|=a_k$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Takes the first quadrant $Q=\{z:\re(z),\im(z)>0\}$ to the strip $S=\{z:\im(z)\in(-2,2)\}$.
        \item Takes the ray $\{z\in Q:\re=\im(z)\}$ to the "sine graph," i.e., $\{z:\im(z)=\sin[\re(z)]\}$.
        \item Takes the segment $\{z\in Q:\re(z)+\im(z)=1\}$ to $S\cap i\R$.

\subsection*{Problems: 5 points each}
In the following, please \emph{fully explain your reasoning} in addition to doing any relevant computations. A correct answer without explanation will receive at most one point on the problem.
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{\arabic*.}}]
    \item Show that $u(x+iy)=\e[2x]\sin(2y)+2x$ is harmonic on $\C$ and find a harmonic conjugate. \emph{Bonus (1pt)}: If $v$ is your harmonic conjugate, express the holomorphic function $f=u+iv$ in terms of $z$.
    \item Suppose that $U$ is a domain, $P$ is a countable set of points in $U$, and that $f\in\mO(U\setminus P)$. Suppose further that $f$ has a pole at each point of $P$. Prove that $P$ is discrete in $U$ (i.e., $P$ does not have any accumulation points in $U$).
    \item Suppose I tell you that $f(z)=1/(z-a)$, but I don't tell you what $a$ is. Suppose that you know the real and imaginary parts of $a$ are irrational and that you have an oracle that can compute $\int_\gamma f\dd{z}$ over any path such that the real and imaginary parts of $\gamma(t)$ are always rational (i.e., any $\gamma$ that lives in $\Q+i\Q$). How would you go about estimating the value of $a$?
    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that if $\{a_k\}$ is a sequence of non-zero complex numbers, then
        \begin{equation*}
            \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{|a_k|}{|a_{k-1}|} = L
            \qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad
            \lim_{k\to\infty}|a_k|^{1/k} = L
        \end{equation*}
        \item Find the radius of convergence of the \textbf{order 0 Bessel function}
        \begin{equation*}
            J_0(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{2^{2n}(n!)^2}z^{2n}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Suppose that $f$ is a function on $\C$ such that\dots
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f$ is ($+i$) anti-periodic, that is, if $f$ is defined at $z$ then it is defined at $z+i$ and $f(z)=-f(z+i)$;
        \item $f$ is holomorphic in the strip $\{z\mid\im(z)\in(-0.1,1.1)\}$ except at the point $z=i/2$;
        \item If $\gamma$ denotes a \emph{clockwise} circle of radius $1/2$ centered at $i/2$, then $\int_\gamma f\dd{z}=17$;
        \item $|f(z)|\to 0$ as $\re(z)\to\pm\infty$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Compute $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\dd{x}$.
\end{enumerate}
