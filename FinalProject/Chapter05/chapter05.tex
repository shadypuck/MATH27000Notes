\section{The Central Force Problem in Quantum Mechanics}
\subsection{Three-Dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger Equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{5/10:}Chapter 4 is all about Bessel functions; not relevant to me at all.
    \item Very much analogously to Chapter 3, the hypergeometric function is used to tackle Legendre's equation, Legendre polynomials, and associated Legendre functions.
    \item Finally derives where $\ell(\ell+1)$ comes from for the first time!
    \item Chebyshev in the exercises, though not relevant to me.
    \item Chapter 6 is Bessel, Neumann, Hankel, and Laguerre (polynomials and associated functions); not relevant to me at all either.
\end{itemize}
