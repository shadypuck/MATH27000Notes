    \item \marginnote{4/23:}Excellent! I'll push you to focus on Hermite and Legendre, as a few other folks are thinking about special functions too, and this way you're all doing different topics.
    \item Also, please please please, in your presentation do not assume that your audience knows the relevant quantum mechanics (you can in the writeup, even though I don't really).
